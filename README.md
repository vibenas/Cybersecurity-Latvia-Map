Notes:

3. Organisations without legal entities but operated locally with agreements as chapters, or as remote unofficial offices in Latvia are linked to the people in charge.
4. Resellers, Integrators, Consultancy, and Technology Developers are combined as their operations overlap, thus not possible clearly to separate.
